# Tabs Layout Demo
This is a layout design that I really enjoy. I think it's unique and fun and looks cool. 
I've always wanted to implement it into a project but could never quite find the right content for it.
So I went ahead and created this demo to challenge myself and give myself a nice CSS puzzle and SASS, DOM practice. 

The trick here is to use a flex container and toggle display from none to flex on tab click. 
Switch the container's flex direction for responsiveness and then just swap the width and height styles on the tabs.
Then use keyframes to animate opacity to give it a nice smooth transition. 
GSAP could also be used to give it some extra flash.

CSS flight school :airplane: :sunglasses:

Simple demo to practice CSS animations. 
Created by using four identical icons and using keyframes to hide/show.
